# While a lot of configuration in Sentry can be changed via the UI, for all
# new-style config (as of 8.0) you can also declare values here in this file
# to enforce defaults or to ensure they cannot be changed via the UI. For more

# If this file ever becomes compromised, it's important to regenerate your SECRET_KEY
# Changing this value will result in all current sessions being invalidated
